### What is this thing?
This is *Le-Catalogue*, a supposed ready-to-launch [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/id) like E-Commerce platform intended to empower the local economy of the village. It remains unfinished due to various complexities that even the locals find difficult to comprehend. Additionally, the creator has knowledge limitations in securely storing sensitive information such as personal data and transaction transcripts, as well as in delivering actual payments to the locals. Therefore, it's unfinished, which is preferable since no one fully understands it. The creator thought it would be helpful to include this description, hoping that most readers will understand the struggles and limitations faced by the creators. Additionally, it is hoped that this unfinished project will be included in the report.

### What is it made off?
Well, the creator thought it would be a good idea to list it since it's simpler.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard). Mostly using this one for the Front-End,
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the styling,
- [Payload](https://payloadcms.com/) for the background operation such like the admin dashboard, payment option, and others,
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for defining URL routes to handle different HTTP methods, alongside configuring middleware for Log-In action, alongside with authentication,
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/), basically just for speed up the process for everything,
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) for adding symbols and alike,
- [Ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for adding components that already exist. Consider it similar to how [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) built the [Falcon 9](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/) rocket (*[reusability concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle#)*), and lastly,
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for Back-End operation such is user data and things alike
