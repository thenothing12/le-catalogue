### notes
- [__for Indonesian translation, click this__](../katalog/indo.md)

- There are some configurations, issues, or bugs that need and I mean literally need to be resolved. One common thing that I've encountered while configuring the site is when it comes to write the __admin dashboard__

- If I'm quite frankly honest, I don't know why these errors or bugs are happening, but my advice is to __PAY ATTENTION__ to the dependencies you've installed. They're called dependencies because you depend on them...

- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) proves invaluable in E-commerce development by facilitating seamless integration with third-party services. One such service is [Payload](https://payloadcms.com/)  a plugin designed to streamline transaction processes for customers while ensuring compatibility with __admin dashboard__ access. 

- [get-payload.ts](../katalog/src/get-payload.ts) & [payload.config.ts](../katalog/src/payload.config.ts), alongside with [server.ts](../katalog/src/server.ts) are crucial files that require close observation and revision, either later or sometime in the future. On my mama there's lot of a fuckin bugs in there, I'm tired as shit...

- Also, don't mess with the ``.env`` file. Seriously, please refrain from touching it. I spent a solid 4 fucking hours tackling bugs caused by meddling with that file. I'm begging you..
